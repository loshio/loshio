This is a blog of Losh, otherwise known as Josh. I like to make things in my spare time, this is where you can find my writeups that I make and the projects I build. Rather than bragging, this is my way of judging progress and sharing with the community at the same time. An egoistitical altruism of sorts... You can contact me via the various social media icons.
