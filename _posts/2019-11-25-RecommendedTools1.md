# Tools

These are a list of all the recommended tools that I want to teach a novice in infosec. Paired with these tools are videos that I found that are great references. Shoutout will be given to each respective creator of tool overview video.

## Notable Tools

These are a list of tools that are considered novice level. This means that the skill needed to use them is relatively low. This does not mean that the tools aren't useful, just that any person getting into the infosec realm can learn them relatively easy. I also beleive this tools to be essential to the infosec professional.

* [NMAP](https://nmap.org/download.html)
    - Simple network scanner for recon on networks/targets. This tool may seem simple, but more than meets the eye with scripts that can be run as options that identify and/or enumerate services. This is a gold standard for infosec professionals and would most likely be found in many top 10 infosec tools lists. For more info go to: [HackerSploit's Video explaining NMAP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MTZdN9TEO4)
* [OWASP Zap](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project)
    - Otherwise known as the Zed Attack Proxy, this tool is great for pointing out vulnerabilties within sites. This tool is great for those who develop sites and aren't familiar with security. For a novice competing in CTF's (Capture the Flags), this tool will help find XSS (crosss-site scripting) vulnerabilties so that you spend less time working on recon and more on attacking. For more information on OWASP Zap: watch [Webpwnized's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSfGeyJKIVA) to learn a little about fuzzing websites.
* [Metasploit Framework](https://www.metasploit.com/download)
    - By far the most hacker-like tool, payloads are loaded and executes with the final stage being the command "exploit". This tool is better known as "Metasploit" or "MSF", as it has become an easy to use tool for those learning about penetration testing. For more information check out [Hak5's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWKyFYMY_Pk) going over the basics of what the tool does.
